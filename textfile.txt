My name is Rakibul Islam. Friends are call me Rakib. 
By the way, I am a frontend developer and now I wanna be backend developer also, that's why I am learning PHP.
Al nahian and Shaon are my instructor. 
I loved their teaching style. Hopefully within 6 months I will be become a very good laravel developer.

Thanks
